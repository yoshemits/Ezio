        <p><em>An Italian <strong>master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Assassins">assassin</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>Ezio was born into Italian nobility from Florence in the year 1459. His family had long been loyal to the Assassin Brotherhood, a fictional organization inspired by the real-life Order of Assassins dedicated to protecting peace and
          freedom, but
          Ezio did not learn about his Assassin heritage until his late teens, after most of his immediate kin were killed during the Pazzi conspiracy. His quest to track down those responsible for killing his family eventually sets him up against
          the
          villainous Templar Order led by the House of Borgia. Spending years to fight against Rodrigo and Cesare Borgia and their henchmen, he eventually re-establishes the Brotherhood as the dominant force in Italy. His further adventures lead him
          to
          Spain and the Ottoman Empire, where he is also essential in overcoming Templar threats and restoring the Assassins. After his retirement from the Order, he lives a peaceful life in rural Tuscany until his eventual death from a heart attack
          in
          1524.</p>
